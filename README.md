### Implementation Timeline
**Phase 1**
Set up necessary libraries and node modules for user interaction and rendering. Add user landing page and begin to write fundamental game logic (e.g. bullet, win/loss conditions, obstacles) along with associated visual elements.

**Phase 2**
Add additional game logic (e.g. tanks, score and levels, time alive) while refining the interface to look visually stunning and simple.

**Phase 3**
Complete foundational game logic and styling of the game. If time permits, begin bonus features including multiplayer functionality, leveling up, and various game modes.
